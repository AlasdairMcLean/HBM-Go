Don't forget all of the MATLAB code is documented in the github wiki: https://github.com/AlasdairMcLean/MATLABprototyping/wiki

Also, all of the current Go code is documented in the go github wiki: https://github.com/AlasdairMcLean/HBM-Go/wiki

Some things that have already been coded in go:

- Matrices, including dot product, transpose, matrix creation, scalar multiplication, display/output, random matrices for testing, ones(), and zeros()

- Summation functions

- Greyscale colormap that returns rgb values

To import the above, add "./hbmutil" to your imports. You can find all the documentation on the HBM-Go wiki listed above.

You can see all the current issues/tasks on the issues page of github: https://github.com/AlasdairMcLean/HBM-Go/issues

for anyone who is using vscode
I recommend installing:

Bookmarks - Allows you to bookmark lines so you don't lose your place
Code Runner - lets you run Go code without needing to use terminal
GitLens - Shows you who wrote what lines of code, some other cool things like seeing revision history, ect
Go - Adds syntax highlighting, snippets, auto-imports (if you reference a package and save, it should automatically import it at the top of the file)
markdownlint - Helps when you document your code in Markdown
Matlab - Syntax highlighting and error messages for matlab 
Project Manager - Helps you jump back and forth between go and matlab
vscode-icons - makes the icons more different so you can see file types easier

when you open vscode, there is a square icon on the left (it's the fifth one down)
if you click that, it will open extensions
you can manually search for those extensions above, and just click install and it will take care of all the installation for you
